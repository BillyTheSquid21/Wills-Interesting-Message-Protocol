This test should do the following:

- Sets up a master process, and a child process
- Both correctly connect to each other
- The child then sends 1,000,000 short instructions to the master, then 50,000 long ones with the time per instruction average being measured (each instruction only increments a counter)

Checks:

- Processes are set up correctly
- Program runs to completion
