This test should do the following:

- Start a master, lib child and an executable child
- The master writes a sequence to a shared memory spot
- Once completed, tell both children to read and check
- Once they finish, they should both write another sequence and tell the master to check

Checks:

- Check that the data table inits
- Check that the data is properly initialized
- Check that both the children correctly read the data
- Check that the sequence the master reads is in the right order, and no race condition was encountered
